	Abstract
	</h3>
	<p>
	The goal of this project is to asses the tone of news reports of an event caused by a country (or some of its citizens) and to use this information to rank countries on how they are seen abroad. We could see its evolution over time and the metric could be compared with the tone national news are reported inside of the country itself.
	We want to use the GDELT dataset (tables export and mentions) to get the tone used by news of country A to talk about events caused by country B.
	The goal and motivation of the project would be to identify countries that are liked abroad (this would be especially interesting if some of these countries are poor) so as to show good examples of behaviour.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Research questions
	</h3>
	<p class="tiret1">
	- What is the reputation of countries seen from abroad ? 
	</p>
	<p class="tiret1">
	- Is this vision different from the image the national news give of the country ?
	</p>
	<p class="tiret1">
	- Is the built estimator statistically reliable (amount of samples) ?
	</p>
	<p class="tiret1">
	- Do the scores vary a lot when we change the assessing methodology (using the confidence attribute 
	of the GDELT database, mean of the opinions vs median opinion) ?
	</p>
	<p class="tiret1">
	- Giving news from "bad" countries less weight to compute the "goodness"
 	of a country (example: Saudi Arabia has bad reputation so don't care so much 
 	that Saudi Arabia criticizes Canada). 
 	</p>
 	<p class="tiret1">
	- Using the *Actor1Type1Code* field to identify the type of actor
 	the event refers to (ex: government, civilians,...) and refine the score of a 
 	country in different scores. This will also reduce the amount of available data 
 	since the *Actor1Type1Code* field is often blank.
 	</p>
 	<p class="tiret1">
 	- Showing differences between the opinions of different mediums inside of  acountry
	</p>
	<h3>
	Dataset
	</h3>
	<p>
	We want to use the GDELT dataset. More precisely we are interested in:
	</p>
	<p class="tiret1">
	- event table (export.csv):
	</p>
		<p class="tiret2">
		- GlobalEventID: the id of the event
		</p>
		<p class="tiret2">
		- MonthYear: the month and year in which the event occured
		</p>
		<p class="tiret2">
		- Actor1CountryCode: Actor1CountryCode is more reliable to determine the first actor 
		nationality than Actor1Geo_CountryCode .
		</p>
		<p class="tiret2">
		- Actor1Type1Code: the type of the actor, to potentially refine the score
		</p>
		<p class="tiret2">
		- AvgTone: if we want to perform some source-independent ranking.
		</p>
	<p class="tiret1">
	- mentions table (mentions.csv):
	</p>
		<p class="tiret2">
		- GlobalEventID: the id of the event
		</p>
		<p class="tiret2">
		- MentionTimeDate: in case we want to sort out news based on older events
		</p>
		<p class="tiret2">
		- MentionSourceName: to get the country of the source, we can use 
		<a href="https://blog.gdeltproject.org/multilingual-source-country-crossreferencing-dataset/" target="_BLANK"> the GDELT mapping from urls to nationnality 
		</a>
		</p>
		<p class="tiret2">
		- Confidence: in case we try to weight the importance of a news based on the confidence GDELT 
		has he computed the metadata correctly
		</p>
		<p class="tiret2">
		- MentionDocTone: the tone used in the article.
		</p>
		<p>
		Regarding the data size, the total dataset weight is of 112GB but it is mostly composed of the GDELT graph which we won't use. After performing the above mentionned data selecting/cleaning, the size of the parquet files were of 0.83 and 3.09 GB (12GB on disc). We thus decided to download a subset of these locally to test our scripts and then to perform the analysis on the real data on the cluster.
