						<em>Whatâ€™s the best thing about Switzerland? -- I don't know, but the flag is a big plus!</em> Jokes about other countries are always fun. But they ask an underlying questions to which they do not answer. How is one country perceived by others? In a positive way? Negative? Is it even known in other countries? If jokes cannot answer it in a satisfactory way, a good analysis of the media publications may enlighten. The aim of this project is to use <a href="https://www.gdeltproject.org/" target="_blank">the GDELT</a> dataset to vizualize the feeling of countries towards each other.
					</p>
					<div class="citation">
						"Supported by Google Jigsaw, the GDELT Project monitors the world's broadcast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every country in over 100 languages and identifies the people, locations, organizations, themes, sources, emotions, counts, quotes, images and events driving our global society every second of every day, creating a free open platform for computing on the entire world."

					</div>
					<p>
						The GDELT Project provides a (very big) list of <strong>events</strong>, each event being <strong>mentionned</strong> in different articles from different media from different countries. Among other things, it makes available for each article the name of the country that caused the event, the url of the media which reported it, and the tone of the article. We exploit all this information to build answers to our questions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Going throught this article, we will first dive into the data to highlight the part we are intresting in. Secondly, we will explore it throught a few graphics and analysis. Finally, we will conclude this datastory with a few words. The code used to construct all these parts can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/NatGr/projectAdA" target="_blank">notebook</a>.

				<hr>
				<div  class="text-justify">
					<p>
						Regarding the data, the main information we used is the tone of the article. It consists of an already computed number quantifying the tone employed by the author to tell about the targeted country, from the most positive (100) to the most negative (-100) tone. The GDELT database also provides the country that caused the event and the url of the source, <a href="https://blog.gdeltproject.org/multilingual-source-country-crossreferencing-dataset/" target="_blank"> from which we can obtain the name of the country</a>. The type of the actor (ex: Government, Military, Police) is also but not always available to refine our analysis. The data we used range from mid-february 2015 to end-november 2017.
					</p>
					<p>
						These informations are then aggregated into several tables: the way a country sees itsef or its actors, the way the rest of the worlds sees a specific country or its actors, the way a country sees another country or its actors and the way a country is seen by medias of different size, according to the number of mentions parsed by GDLET. Our main metric is the average tone of all the articles in each category.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						Another important point to stress out is that the GDELT database is itself biased in the news it contains. Taking the example of Belgium: <br>
					</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col">
							<p>
								We can see that the biggest websites in belgium are mostly european news, this is not that surprising in itself that Belgium got attributed the european websites and that these are more important than belgian news (altough 9000 mentions is quite small, <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/" target="_blank">swissinfo.ch</a> got 330,000 for example). The concern here is that, at the exception of <a href="http://www.deredactie.be" target="_blank">deredactie.be</a>, belgian mainstream news websites (<a href="http://www.demorgen.be" target="_blank">demorgen.be</a>, <a href="http://www.rtbf.be" target="_blank">rtbf.be</a> and <a href="http://www.lalibre.be" target="_blank">lalibre.be</a>) have very few number of mentions. 
								<br>
								The same pattern can be observed in France with <a href="http://www.france24.com" target="_blank">france24.com</a> having 340,000 mentions and <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr" target="_blank">lemonde.fr</a> only having 182 or in Germany with <a href="https://www.thelocal.de/" target="_blank">thelocal.de</a> having 37,000 and <a href="http://http://www.spiegel.de/" target="_blank">spiegel.de</a> having 8000. 
							</p>
							<p>
								What we can observe here, is that websites that are available in english (all of the medias mentionned here with more than 1000 references except for <a href="http://http://www.spiegel.de/" target="_blank">spiegel.de</a>) have much much more mentions that websites in other (widly spread) languages. This introduces a huge bias towards internationnal websites and is quite unfortunate. It also explains why there are so much mentions of the United States and allows for another interpretation of the small versus big media analysis, the interpretation of native versus english speaker websites.

								To assess the statistical reliability of these informations, confidence intervals were computed. However, the approximation we used (see the <a href="https://github.com/NatGr/projectAdA" target="_blank">notebook</a> for more details) is not valid for a small number of mentions. Thus, we chose not to show confidence intervals when the number of mentions is below 10000 in the following plots, but these are otherwise displayed by hovering over a country. In the same vein, we do not show metrics when the number of mentions is below 2000 which results in white areas on the maps. This is rather conservative but missing information was preferred over displaying misleading data.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the graph, we can see that most of the countries have more than a hundred thousand mentions and only a part of less than 3% have less than ten thousand mentions. For the future results, we will be careful if countries from this last part are involved.

						The following choropleth map shows us that countries from the African continent and South America tend to have less mentions than other country. In contrast, the United States is the country with the most mentions so it would be interessant to analyse the result of this country.

						Looking more closely at the case of articles whose target country is the USA, we can note that the average tone of the US media is -2.64, and that of the non-USA media is -2.30. Is it really significant, or is it a marginal phenomenon highlighted by our choice of visualization? To answer that, we are going to analyse the negative average tone articles. Furthermore, as we saw above that more than 75 % of countries have more than one hundred thousand mentions so we decide to keep only those countries in order to avoid wrong interpretation as we mentioned.
						<br>
						In summary, we take only the entries that correspond to negative value of average tone and a number of mentions greater than one hundred thousand.

					</figure>
					<p>
						We observe that there is a country in the center of the graph with a lot of edges. This country is the United States. This means that for more than one hundred thousand events, a lot of country mentions negatively the USA. Actually, 111 countries talk about USA negatively with more than one hundred thousand mentions, which is huge.

								The obvious way to assess how good a country is perceived by others is to compute the mean opinion on the rest of the world over that country. This is what the previous map shows, we can see that Canada, Sweden and the Baltic countries are doing quite well but that is also the case for the US, China and most southern african countries. On the other hand, Europe is not that well seen and central Africa is very often critizised. <br>
								An improvement over this criterion would be to weigh less countries with bad reputation (e.g. we should not consider that Somalia dislikes Canada to assess the popularity of Canada) but this nearly doesn't change the scores, so we can conclude that the previous mentionned example doesn't occur often.
							</p>
							<p>
								We can conclude from the previous that it is still possible to been seen in a god way abroad even for poor countries (Namibia, Botsanawa, Ghana) and that Asian Countries are doing quite well.

						<p>
							Another interesting indicator to look at is difference between how a country percieves itself and what the rest of the world thinks. We can see that, withtout surprise, the huge majority of countries have a positively biased opinion of themselves. That bias is most important in Asia, Africa, South America and Eastern Europe than in Western Europe and North America.
						</p>
						<p>
							This might be correlated with freedom of press, to check that hypothesys, we computed the correlation between the difference in opinions and the <a href="https://rsf.org/en/ranking/2016#" target="_blank">Reporters without borders 2016 World Press Freedom Index</a>. Unfortunately, the experiment showed inconclusive which makes sense due to the complexity of evaluation of RWB Index.

					<div class="part" id="clustering">
						<div class="title">Clustering the different countries</div>
						<p>
							Another interesting idea is to try to compute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis" target="_blank">clusters</a>. To compute these, we only used the 40 biggest countries. We can regroup countries in two ways, either by the way they are perceived by the outer world (clustering by popularity) or by the way they perceive the rest of the world (clustering by opinion). We computed both in the following, we also computed the clusters for each actor types. However, the obtained dendograms do not show any particularly interesting information and are thus omitted of this page, you can see them <a href="clusters.html" target="_blank">here</a>
						</p>
					</div>
					<hr>
					<div class="part" id="types">
						<div class="title">Influence of actor types</div>
						<p>
							An interesting data that GDELT gives us about the actor of an event is its type, a lot of different types are used but the most common are: Police, Education, Government, Judiciary, Legislature, Media, Big Corporations and Military. <br>
							We can refine our analysis based on these types and we get the following map for the opinion of the rest of the world on a given country. An important remark is that GDELT doesn't always specifies the type of the actor so using this field reduces the number of available data (thus the increased number of white countries).
						</p>
						<iframe class="media" height="600"  allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="plots/outer_opinion_by_type.html"></iframe>
						<p>
							First of all, analysing the global trends shows us that Big Corporations and Education are quite popular wheras Media, Military, Judiciary and Police are not at all. We can see that government popularity follows the same trend as the global popularity. We can see that Military are especially inpopular in Central Africa, the Middle East, Ukraine and Venezuela which makes sense due to the rebellions and military conflicts in these zones.
						</p>
					</div>
					<hr>
					<div class="part" id="medias">
						<div class="title">What about the size of the media that reports a news?</div>
						<p>
							For the following analysis, medias were separated into 3 different size groups (others were tested as well but 3 shows the more insight). These groups were computed by ordering the media by importance and grouping them so as to have groups with roughly the same number of mentions. This was done separately for each country, so that each country has medias in all of the categories. <br> In case one of the groups was below the treshold to show him on the map, we hid the other groups of the same country as well for coherence. 
						</p>
						<iframe class="media" height="600"  allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="plots/media_inner.html"></iframe>
						<p>
							The previous map shows the opinion of the media of a country about itself for different sizes of medias. As explained before, smaller should also be interpreted as non-english speaking media here. We can see that depending on the country, the size of the media has a more or less important influence on the average opinion. We can nevertheless note that the variation is usually quite important. For most country, small medias have a better national opinion whereas big and medium countries have a worse opinion.
						</p>
						<iframe class="media" height="600"  allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="plots/media_outer.html"></iframe>
						<p class="text-justify">
							Here, we can see the opinion on a country of small/medium/big medias of the other countries. There is not much difference between medium and big medias, however, small medias have a much better opinion of the outer world than medium or big ones. TODO: tester si c'est du simpson
